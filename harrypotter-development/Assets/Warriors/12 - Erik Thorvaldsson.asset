  description: "Erik Thorvaldsson, known as Erik the Red, was a Norse explorer, described
    in medieval and Icelandic saga sources as having founded the first settlement
    in Greenland. He most likely earned the epithet \"the Red\" due to the color
    of his hair and beard. According to Icelandic sagas, he was born in the J\xE6ren
    district of Rogaland, Norway, as the son of Thorvald Asvaldsson. One of Erik's
    sons was the well-known Icelandic explorer Leif Erikson."
