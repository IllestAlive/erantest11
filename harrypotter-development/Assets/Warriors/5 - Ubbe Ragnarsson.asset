  description: Ubba was a 9th-century Viking and one of the commanders of the Great
    Heathen Army that invaded Anglo-Saxon England in the 860s. The Great Army appears
    to have been a coalition of warbands drawn from Scandinavia, Ireland, the Irish
    Sea region and Continental Europe. There is reason to suspect that a proportion
    of the Viking forces specifically originated in Frisia, where some Viking commanders
    are known to have held fiefdoms on behalf of the Franks. Some sources describe
    Ubba as dux of the Frisians, which could be evidence that he also associated
    with a Frisian benefice.
