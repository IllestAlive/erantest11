  description: "Bj\xF6rn Ironside, according to Norse legends, was a Norse Viking
    chief and Swedish king. According to the 12th- and 13th-century Scandinavian
    histories, he was the son of notorious Viking king Ragnar Lodbrok and lived in
    the 9th century, being dated between 855 and 858. Bj\xF6rn Ironside is said to
    have been the first ruler of the Swedish Muns\xF6 dynasty. In the early 18th
    century, a barrow on the island of Muns\xF6 was claimed by antiquarians to be
    Bj\xF6rn J\xE4rnsidas h\xF6g or Bj\xF6rn Ironside's barrow."
